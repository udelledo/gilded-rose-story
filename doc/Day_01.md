# Day one

We offer our services to the Gilded Rose company.

We took a look at the [requirements](https://github.com/emilybache/GildedRose-Refactoring-Kata/blob/main/GildedRoseRequirements.txt) and we have been told that the application just works, there's even a test!

We get our gradle project and we run 

```bash
./gradlew :test
```

And the build ended up successfully with the output
```
BUILD SUCCESSFUL in 702ms
3 actionable tasks: 1 executed, 2 up-to-date
```
